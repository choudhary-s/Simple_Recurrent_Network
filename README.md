Through this code I have tried to understand the concepts of a simple recurrent neural network. 
Recurrent networks are best for sequence data.

To implement rnn using only, I learned the concepts from Sequence Models course on coursera by Prof. Andrew Ng. I also took help from Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera repository.
I am deeply thankful to both of them.
